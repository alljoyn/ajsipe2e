The core of SIP E2E connector is CloudCommEngine. It uses the IMSTransport module to
communicate with the IMS server in the cloud via the SIP protocol. On the one hand,it 
wraps the local AllJoyn messages into SIP messages and sends the SIP messages to the 
IMS server so that those local AllJoyn interfaces (i.e., methods, properties, and signals) 
may be accessed and used by the cloud and remote AllJoyn devices and applications. On 
the other hand, when it receives SIP messages from the IMS server, it unwraps the remote 
AllJoyn messages from the SIP messages and instantiate the proxy bus objects so that 
local AllJoyn devices/applications may access and use the AllJoyn interfaces provided 
by the cloud and remote AllJoyn devices and applications.

TODOs
1. Currently the IMSTransport module depends on Doubango and this dependency will
be removed before the release.
2. Will use scons to add the build option on other platforms like Linux.
3. Will modify the connector to be compatible with the gateway agent framework.
